Data Scientist Role Play: Profiling and Analyzing the Yelp Dataset Coursera Worksheet

This is a 2-part assignment. In the first part, you are asked a series of questions that will help you profile and understand the data just like a data scientist would. For this first part of the assignment, you will be assessed both on the correctness of your findings, as well as the code you used to arrive at your answer. You will be graded on how easy your code is to read, so remember to use proper formatting and comments where necessary.

In the second part of the assignment, you are asked to come up with your own inferences and analysis of the data for a particular research question you want to answer. You will be required to prepare the dataset for the analysis you choose to do. As with the first part, you will be graded, in part, on how easy your code is to read, so use proper formatting and comments to illustrate and communicate your intent as required.

For both parts of this assignment, use this "worksheet." It provides all the questions you are being asked, and your job will be to transfer your answers and SQL coding where indicated into this worksheet so that your peers can review your work. You should be able to use any Text Editor (Windows Notepad, Apple TextEdit, Notepad ++, Sublime Text, etc.) to copy and paste your answers. If you are going to use Word or some other page layout application, just be careful to make sure your answers and code are lined appropriately.
In this case, you may want to save as a PDF to ensure your formatting remains intact for you reviewer.



Part 1: Yelp Dataset Profiling and Understanding

1. Profile the data by finding the total number of records for each of the tables below:
	
    i. Attribute table = 10,000
    ii. Business table = 10,000
    iii. Category table = 10,000
    iv. Checkin table = 10,000
    v. elite_years table = 10,000
    vi. friend table = 10,000
    vii. hours table = 10,000
    viii. photo table = 10,000
    ix. review table = 10,000
    x. tip table = 10,000
    xi. user table = 10,000
	


2. Find the total number of distinct records for the primary keys in each of the tables listed below:

    i. Business = 10,000
    ii. Hours = 2,052
    iii. Category = 2,643 
    iv. Attribute = 1,115
    v. Review = 10,000
    vi. Checkin = 493
    vii. Photo = 10,000
    viii. Tip = 537
    ix. User = 10,000
    x. Friend = 11
    xi. Elite_years = 2,780

Note: Primary Keys are denoted in the ER-Diagram with a yellow key icon.	



3. Are there any columns with null values in the Users table? Indicate "yes," or "no."

	Answer: no
	
	
	SQL code used to arrive at answer:
    /* Count total number of nulls from all of the columns */
    SELECT COUNT(*)
      FROM user
     WHERE (id OR name OR review_count OR yelping_since OR useful OR funny 
           OR cool OR fans OR average_stars OR compliment_hot OR compliment_more OR compliment_profile OR compliment_cute OR compliment_list OR compliment_note OR compliment_plain OR compliment_cool OR compliment_funny OR compliment_writer OR compliment_photos) 
           IS NULL
	

	
4. For each table and column listed below, display the smallest (minimum), largest (maximum), and average (mean) value for the following fields:

	i. Table: Review, Column: Stars
	
		min: 1		max: 5		avg: 3.7082
		
	
	ii. Table: Business, Column: Stars
	
		min: 1		max: 5		avg: 3.6549
		
	
	iii. Table: Tip, Column: Likes
	
		min: 0		max: 2		avg: 0.0144
		
	
	iv. Table: Checkin, Column: Count
	
		min: 1		max: 53		avg: 1.9414
		
	
	v. Table: User, Column: Review_count
	
		min: 0		max: 2000	avg: 24,2995
		


5. List the cities with the most reviews in descending order:

	SQL code used to arrive at answer:
    /* Calculate total number of reviews per city */
    /* Select cities column, sort by this sum */
    SELECT SUM(review_count) AS total_per_city 
           ,city
      FROM business
     GROUP BY city
     ORDER BY total_per_city DESC

6. Find the distribution of star ratings to the business in the following cities:

    i. Avon

    SQL code used to arrive at answer:
    /* Select all businesses in Avon */
    /* Show number of reviews and rating of each business */
    SELECT stars
           ,count(stars)
      FROM business
     WHERE city = 'Avon'
     GROUP BY stars

    Copy and Paste the Resulting Table Below (2 columns – star rating and count):
    +-------+--------------+
    | stars | count(stars) |
    +-------+--------------+
    |   1.5 |            1 |
    |   2.5 |            2 |
    |   3.5 |            3 |
    |   4.0 |            2 |
    |   4.5 |            1 |
    |   5.0 |            1 |
    +-------+--------------+

    ii. Beachwood

    SQL code used to arrive at answer:
    SELECT stars
           ,count(stars)
      FROM business
     WHERE city = 'Beachwood'
     GROUP BY stars

    Copy and Paste the Resulting Table Below (2 columns – star rating and count):
    +-------+--------------+
    | stars | count(stars) |
    +-------+--------------+
    |   2.0 |            1 |
    |   2.5 |            1 |

    |   4.5 |            2 |
    |   5.0 |            5 |
    +-------+--------------+


7. Find the top 3 users based on their total number of reviews:
		
	SQL code used to arrive at answer:
    /* Select user name and review count from user */
    /* Sort results by review count high to low */
	SELECT name
       ,review_count
      FROM user
     ORDER BY review_count DESC
     LIMIT 3
		
	Copy and Paste the Result Below:
    +--------+--------------+
    | name   | review_count |
    +--------+--------------+
    | Gerald |         2000 |
    | Sara   |         1629 |
    | Yuri   |         1339 |
    +--------+--------------+		

8. Does posting more reviews correlate with more fans?

	Please explain your findings and interpretation of the results:
    It seems true on a larger scale, but not a smaller scale. Sorting all users by review_count, we can see that the number of fans is not sorted in descending order at all. To make sure this isn't just a phenomenon for the users with the highest number of reviews, we can also upper bound the review_count at 500, 300, 100, and 50 -- in each of these cases, we see that sorting by review_count does not also sort by number of fans. It is, however, true that those with ~50 reviews have noticeably fewer fans than those with ~300 reviews, who have noticeably fewer than the top couple users by review count. It also seems that there is much more variation on the higher end (those with very many reviews) than on the low end (those with very few reviews), as those with few reviews seem to uniformly have only a handful of fans. 
    Intuitively, this finding makes sense -- the average person probably only need to see one or two reviews they really like to become a "fan" of a user. Writing hundreds of reviews increases the chance that your reviews will be seen, but does not mean your reviews are high quality; therefore, we'd expect some correlation between review count and number of fans, but not perfect correlation, and diminishing returns on huge numbers of reviews.
	

	
9. Are there more reviews with the word "love" or with the word "hate" in them?

	Answer: There are more with the word "love"

	SQL code used to arrive at answer:
    /* Make indicator variables for containing "love" and "hate" */
    /* Sum indicator columns to get number of reviews for each condition */
    SELECT SUM( CASE
                WHEN text LIKE '%love%' THEN 1
                ELSE 0
                END) AS love
           ,SUM( CASE
                WHEN text LIKE '%hate%' THEN 1
                ELSE 0
                END) AS hate
      FROM review

	
	
10. Find the top 10 users with the most fans:

	SQL code used to arrive at answer:
    /* Order users by number of fans */
    /* Display columns for id, name, and number of fans */
    SELECT id
       ,name
       ,fans
      FROM user
     ORDER BY fans DESC
     LIMIT 10
	
	
	Copy and Paste the Result Below:
    +------------------------+-----------+------+
    | id                     | name      | fans |
    +------------------------+-----------+------+
    | -9I98YbNQnLdAmcYfb324Q | Amy       |  503 |

    | -lh59ko3dxChBSZ9U7LfUw | Lissa     |  120 |
    +------------------------+-----------+------+
	
	
11. Is there a strong relationship (or correlation) between having a high number of fans and being listed as "useful" or "funny?" Out of the top 10 users with the highest number of fans, what percent are also listed as “useful” or “funny”?

Key:
0% - 25% - Low relationship
26% - 75% - Medium relationship
76% - 100% - Strong relationship
	
	SQL code used to arrive at answer:
    /* Show username, number of fans, and number of useful/funny ratings */
    SELECT name
       ,fans
       ,useful
       ,funny
      FROM user
     ORDER BY fans DESC
     LIMIT 10
	
	Copy and Paste the Result Below:
	+-----------+------+--------+--------+
    | name      | fans | useful |  funny |
    +-----------+------+--------+--------+
    | Amy       |  503 |   3226 |   2554 |
    | Mimi      |  497 |    257 |    138 |
    | Harald    |  311 | 122921 | 122419 |
    | Gerald    |  253 |  17524 |   2324 |
    | Christine |  173 |   4834 |   6646 |
    | Lisa      |  159 |     48 |     13 |
    | Cat       |  133 |   1062 |    672 |
    | William   |  126 |   9363 |   9361 |
    | Fran      |  124 |   9851 |   7606 |
    | Lissa     |  120 |    455 |    150 |
    +-----------+------+--------+--------+
	
	Please explain your findings and interpretation of the results:
	I'm not sure this question makes sense, since reviews are useful/funny, not users. However, 100% of these 10 have reviews that are marked as useful/funny, so I suppose that means there is a strong relationship between useful/funny reviews and having lots of fans, which makes sense.
	
	

Part 2: Inferences and Analysis

1. Pick one city and category of your choice and group the businesses in that city or category by their overall star rating. Compare the businesses with 2-3 stars to the businesses with 4-5 stars and answer the following questions. Include your code.
	
    i. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different distribution of hours?
    The group of restaurants with higher ratings are open slightly fewer hours on average, and open slightly later, but the differences are relatively small.

    ii. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different number of reviews?
    Yes, the group of restaurants with higher ratings have more reviews on average. The min number of reviews is similar, but the max number is much higher.
             
    iii. Are you able to infer anything from the location data provided between these two groups? Explain.
    All restaurants in Downtown Core and Entertainment District are low-rated, while Etobicoke, High Park, and Niagara contain high-rated restaurants.

    SQL code used for analysis:
    /* Select restaurants in Toronto, ON */
    /* Join hours, category, and business tables on business ID */
    /* Create category column to indicate "high" and "low" rated restaurants */
    /* Get average number of hours open, closing hour, and opening hour */
    /* Get average, min, and max number of reviews */
    /* Sort by neighborhood for part iii */
    SELECT h.hours
       ,b.neighborhood
       ,b.review_count
       ,CASE 
             WHEN b.stars >= 4 THEN 'High'
             WHEN b.stars >= 2 AND b.stars < 4 THEN 'Low'
             END rating_cat -- build category variable
       ,MIN(b.review_count) -- next three lines are for part ii
       ,MAX(b.review_count)
       ,AVG(b.review_count)
       /* following lines are for part iii */
       ,AVG(STRFTIME('%H', SUBSTR(h.hours, -5))) AS avg_close_hour
       ,AVG(STRFTIME('%H', SUBSTR(h.hours, -11, 5))) AS avg_open_hour
       ,AVG(STRFTIME('%H', SUBSTR(h.hours, -5)) - 
          STRFTIME('%H', SUBSTR(h.hours, -11, 5))) AS avg_hours_open
      FROM business AS b
           /* Joining tables, matching business ID from each */
           INNER JOIN hours as h
                   ON b.id = h.business_id
           INNER JOIN category as c
                   ON b.id = c.business_id
     /* Select only restaurants in Toronto, ON */
     WHERE b.city = 'Toronto' 
           AND b.state = 'ON'
           AND c.category = 'Restaurants'
     GROUP BY neighborhood, rating_cat -- neighborhood only for part iii
		
		
2. Group business based on the ones that are open and the ones that are closed. What differences can you find between the ones that are still open and the ones that are closed? List at least two differences and the SQL code you used to arrive at your answer.
		
    i. Difference 1:
    Businesses that are still open have more reviews on average than ones that are closed          
             
    ii. Difference 2:
    Reviews for businesses that are still open are more likely to be funny than for ones that are closed
             
    SQL code used for analysis:
    SELECT b.is_open
           ,AVG(b.review_count)
           ,AVG(r.funny)
      FROM business AS b
           INNER JOIN review AS r
                   ON r.business_id = b.id
     GROUP BY is_open
	
	
3. For this last part of your analysis, you are going to choose the type of analysis you want to conduct on the Yelp dataset and are going to prepare the data for analysis.

Ideas for analysis include: Parsing out keywords and business attributes for sentiment analysis, clustering businesses to find commonalities or anomalies between them, predicting the overall star rating for a business, predicting the number of fans a user will have, and so on. These are just a few examples to get you started, so feel free to be creative and come up with your own problem you want to solve. Provide answers, in-line, to all of the following:
	
    i. Indicate the type of analysis you chose to do:
    Predicting the rating for a business.
             
    ii. Write 1-2 brief paragraphs on the type of data you will need for your analysis and why you chose that data:
    We will need data from attributes that I think may play into modeling what a business's rating will be. From this dataset, I think the business location, review count, hours, category, review classifications, and tip text will play a part. 
    Additionally, we will need the rating of the businesses to use in training or assessing the accuracy of our model.                               
                      
    iii. Output of your finished dataset:
    +------------------------+--------------+-----------+-------+--------------+--------------------+------------------+--------+-------+------+
    | id                     | neighborhood | city      | state | review_count | hours              | category         | useful | funny | cool |
